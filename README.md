# DSA-Project-Data-Structure-Operations-Management-System
Overview
This project is a comprehensive Data Structure Operations Management System implemented in C++. It integrates various data structures and algorithms to provide a modular, interactive platform for exploring fundamental operations on arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and sorting algorithms. The system also incorporates both linear and binary search for efficient data retrieval. It is designed to be a practical tool for understanding and applying core data structure concepts in real-world scenarios.

Key Features
Array Operations:

Insert, delete, copy, reverse, and merge elements.
Dynamic handling and modification of array sizes.
Linked List Operations:

Insertion, deletion, and node counting.
Supports singly linked lists with interactive manipulation.
Stack Implementations:

Stack operations using both arrays and linked lists.
Includes push, pop, peek, and display functionalities.
Queue Implementations:

Queue operations using linked lists.
Enqueue, dequeue, peek, and rear functionalities.
Tree Traversals:

Implements in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversal techniques.
Searching Algorithms:

Linear and binary search for data retrieval.
Sorting Algorithms:

Selection sort, bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, and radix sort for organizing data.
User-Friendly Menu:

Categorized operations into linear, non-linear, searching, and sorting sections for easier navigation.
